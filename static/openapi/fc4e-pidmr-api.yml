  title: PID Meta Resolver - PIDMR-API
  description: "PID Meta Resolver: The PID Meta Resolver is a generalized resolver\
    \ for mapping items into records. Actually the \_PID Meta Resolver will\_ know\
    \ where to route different types of identifier â€“ ex. DOI, URN:NBN.\_\_PID Meta\
    \ Resolver which should improve machine based data processing and allows to get\
    \ digital object information without in-depth knowledge of the resolution mechanism\
    \ of different PID systems. That enhances the collection and analysis of data\
    \ collections originating not only from different sources also referenced by different\
    \ PID systems. The PID Meta Resolver should return a minimal set of information.\
    \ This creates the connection with the PID Kernel Information.\_"
